\title{\textbf{Data Compression \& Data Hiding during Large Data Ingestion}}
\begin{position}
    A Java based web application which compress data retrieved from MySQL database, then hide the data over an audio file. The output file is known as "stega-audio". The stega-audio is then forwarded to HDFS storage. The stega-audio file is simply an audio file which has no difference from the original audio file. With the specific decryptor, the hidden data in the audio file can be retrieved. \vspace{0.3cm}
